## Archive Maintenance

This archive is organized to:
- Keep root directory clean (only active specs and README)
- Preserve implementation history
- Make document discovery easier
- Separate completed features from active development

**When to Archive**:
- Feature is complete and tested
- Document is superseded by newer version
- Quick reference docs after feature integration

**What Stays in Root/Docs**:
- Active specifications
- Current implementation logs
- Main README and roadmap
- Architecture documentation
